In this project I am implementing some of the latest deep learning and machine learning algorithms to help doctors diagnose various fatal diseases with the help of computers and power of deep learning.

Currently Implemented:

1. [Atrial fibrillation from ecg scan using MIT-bih dataset.](https://github.com/Ritesh313/Health_cad/blob/master/ECGclassification)
2. [Detecting Malaria from blood cell microscopic images.](https://github.com/Ritesh313/Health_cad/tree/master/malaria)
3. [Pneumonia detection from chestxray images with class activation maps.](https://github.com/Ritesh313/Health_cad/blob/master/pneumoniadensenet.ipynb)
